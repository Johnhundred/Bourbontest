                    <p>Particle Designs is the natural development of two people - Ralf and John - working together over the course
                        of several years. In late August 2014, we both started our Multimedia Design education at KEA - Copenhagens
                        School of Design and Technology. From the very first day of that education, through various groups and tasks,
                        we worked together. A shared passion for not just doing what was required, but for doing exceptional work,
                        was what drove us forward and, 2 years down the line, lead to us to the creation of Particle Designs.</p>

                        <p>Used to coding since early school days, Ralf-Patrik Blaga took his skills further by integrating not just
                            design work, but by becoming a capable organiser and project leader. Originally from Satu Mare, Romania,
                            Ralf moved to Copenhagen to pursue education in the field, further increasing his skills.</p>

                        <p>With over 5 years of design and coding experience, Johannes Skjærbæk is an integral part of Particle
                            Designs. He was born in Silkeborg, Jutland, but has been forgiven of this crime in recent years, having
                            made his new home in Copenhagen, learning the web development and design trade.</p>
